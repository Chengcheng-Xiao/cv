summary: >
  I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate at Imperial College London. 
  My research focuses on developing new methods, particularly density functional
  theory, for the accurate and efficient simulation of materials. 
  I apply these methods to investigate the properties of various materials, 
  including ferroic materials, hydrogen storage materials, superconductors,
  and topological materials that are of interest to both the scientific 
  community and industry.
